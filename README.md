# Maze_solver

Description:
The "Java Maze Solver" project is a software application developed in Java that aims to solve mazes using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing. The primary objective of this project is to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination within a given maze, ensuring efficiency and minimal steps.

Tech Stack:

Java: The core programming language used for implementing the maze solving algorithms and application logic.
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA): Various algorithms will be utilized to find the shortest path in the maze efficiently.
Java Swing: The GUI framework employed to design and visualize the maze and the shortest path solution.
Key Features:

Maze Generation and Visualization:

The application allows users to generate random mazes or manually input custom mazes through the GUI.
The maze will be displayed using Java Swing components, providing a visual representation of the maze's layout.
Maze Solving Algorithms:

The project will implement several DSA-based algorithms for maze solving, such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A* (A Star) algorithm.
Users can select their preferred algorithm for solving the maze.
Minimal Path Finding:

The primary focus of the project is to find the shortest path from the maze's starting point to the destination using the selected algorithm.
The chosen algorithm will ensure the minimal number of steps required to reach the destination.
Real-Time Visualization:

During the maze-solving process, the application will update the GUI in real-time to illustrate the algorithm's progress and the path finding process.
Users can observe how the algorithm explores different paths and ultimately identifies the shortest one.
Step-by-Step Mode:

The project will offer a step-by-step mode that allows users to observe each iteration of the algorithm, providing insights into how the maze solving process works.
User Interaction:

Users can interact with the GUI to pause, resume, or reset the maze solving process.
The application will display the minimum path and the number of steps taken to reach the destination once the maze is solved.
Error Handling:

The application will handle scenarios where a maze is unsolvable or invalid, providing appropriate error messages to users.
Overall, the "Java Maze Solver" project is an interactive and educational tool that allows users to explore different maze solving algorithms while visualizing the process in real-time. With the use of DSA and an intuitive Java Swing-based GUI, users can efficiently find the shortest path in mazes, making the project a valuable learning resource and a fun exploration of pathfinding techniques.
